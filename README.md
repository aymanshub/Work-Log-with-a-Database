# Work Log with a Database
A console program where employees can officially record their daily tasks.
The records will be stored in a dedicated Data-Base and table.

Each task consists of:
  * Employee name
  * Task title
  * Spent time on task
  * Task notes
  * Task date (the date the task was recorded)

note: the Task date is automatically generated based on the current date when the task was recorded, yet
      the task date can be changed by finding a task and editing it.

Intallation:
  * install\make sure all the required packages in the requirements.txt file are installed.

Enjoy,
Ayman.
